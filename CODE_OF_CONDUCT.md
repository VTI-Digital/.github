# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the VTI community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our Code of Conduct to be honored.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to:

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible at help@vti.digital.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## 6. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify VTI with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 7. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues, online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
